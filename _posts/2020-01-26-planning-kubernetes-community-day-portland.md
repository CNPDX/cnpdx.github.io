title: Planning for the 2020 Portland Kubernetes Community Day has begun!
tags: ["community day 2020"]

We are planning a [Kubernetes Community Day](https://kubernetescommunitydays.org/) here in Portland!
Kubernetes Community Days are community-organized events that serve the community
created by people who live and work in those communities.

The Kubernetes Community Day is going to be Saturday September 12, 2020 at Puppet.
We still need your help though! We need to know what you would like
to see at the Portland Kubernetes Community Day.

Please [take our 2020 Portland Kubernetes Community Day Survey](https://forms.gle/w5rkJqdEwkndYxHd6)
and tell us what topics you want to hear about in the Cloud Native and Kubernetes space.

We're looking forward to hearing from you and seeing you on the first Kubernetes
Community Day in Portland.
